THzRadar
========

This code base is an attempt to translate reflections from a 30GHz antenna into complete 3D models. Earlier versions were conducted in MATLAB and produced cross-sections parallel to the plane of the transmitter and receiver. A secondary mission is to improve the efficiency of image generation so that full 3D images can be generated in minutes rather than an hour or more.
